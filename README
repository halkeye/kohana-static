Static Controller
=================

Lets you setup static content in your views directories.

application/views/js/main.js
application/views/js/error.js

Then in your view:
=====
echo HTML::script('static/js/main,error.js', NULL, TRUE);

This allows various files to be setup in modules, and then overridden in applications (or other modules)
